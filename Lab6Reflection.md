# Reflection

1. The project shows inheritance by having the Hero and Enemy classes take attributes and methods from the Character class. This allows them to share common functionalities and characteristics.
2. The project demonstrates composition,as a form of association, by having the Character class contain a Weapon object as part of its state. This is apparent in the equip() method, where a Weapon object is associated with a Character object.
3. Encapsulation is illustrated by bundling data and methods into classes. Each class encapsulates its data and behavior, by providing a clear interface for interacting with objects. However, in the given code, the attributes are public, limiting the demonstration of encapsulation.
